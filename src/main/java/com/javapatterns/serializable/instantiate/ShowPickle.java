/**
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to display a set of buttons
 * which were previously serialized in order to demostrate the
 * use of the "instantiate" method provided by the Beans class.
 * In order to execute this program, use the following command:
 *
 *    java ShowButtons [file basename #1] [file basename #2]...
 *
 * For example, If you had a green, 16-point Start button; a
 * yellow, 20-point Yield button; and a red, 30-point Stop
 * button; then the following command would apply:
 *
 *    java ShowButton Start16G Yield20Y Stop30R
 *
 * The file names of the serialized buttons must end in 
 * ".ser".  However, the extension should not be specified
 * as part of the command arguments.  There is not limit on
 * the number of buttons to display.
